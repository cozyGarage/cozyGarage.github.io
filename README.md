## 🎮 How to Play

### Rules

1. **Starting Position**: The game begins with 4 discs in the center (2 black, 2 white in diagonal pattern)
2. **Valid Moves**: Place your disc to flip at least one opponent's disc by sandwiching them between your discs
3. **Taking Turns**: Black moves first, then players alternate
4. **Passing**: If no valid moves are available, your turn is automatically skipped
5. **Game End**: The game ends when neither player can make a valid move
6. **Winner**: The player with the most discs wins!

### Strategy Tips

- 🎯 Corner positions are the most valuable - they can't be flipped!
- 🛡️ Edge positions are also strong but can be more vulnerable
- 🤔 Think ahead - consider how your opponent might respond
- ⚖️ Balance offense and defense throughout the game
